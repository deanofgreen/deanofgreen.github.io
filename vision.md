### A New High for Precinct 420

We've made great leaps towards a successful future, but the Dean of Green looks to open our horizons and discover a more vibrant world. A better world. 

### Keeping Tualatin Green

The Dean of Green will keep Tualatin green by promoting plant growth, urban farming, and communal gardens. He believes increased plant growth could help the community bond and see the true beauty of nature. He believes all plants, regardless of appearance, scent, and uses, should be cared for and valued equally.

### Climate Change
The Dean of Green believes climate change is the greatest threat to the US in existence. He believes by growing more plants and weeds this change can be reduced or even reversed.

### Trade
The Dean of Green is highly pro-trade and free market. He believes this will allow far greater access to key goods and greater market choice, particularly in the recreation sector.

### Immigration
The Dean of Green supports open borders between the US and its neighbors to encourage immigration and strengthen cultural ties. He believes this cultural exchange would promote happiness and calmness throughout the world.

### Healthcare
The Dean of Green strongly believes in reforming medical plans such that they allow access to desperately needed drugs and treatment options to those in need, or those who simply want a wider variety of options.
